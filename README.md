The vision behind target synergy was to have a tool for audience engagement at large scale with live polls, opinions and feedback. Since this is an in-house built tool we can customise everything according to our need at target and data insights can be taken internally.
Target Synergy is an audience engagement platform with minimum involvement of third party tools to keep all the data secured. The features available are live polls, opinions and feedback. The presenter can engage the participant under the categories like multiple choice questions, rating ,open ended ,word cloud scales and q and a. The link can be shared with the participant from which they can submit their answers. The presenter can view the answers and use the same data.
